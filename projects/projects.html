<h1>Projects</h1>
<h4>Throughout my academic and professional career I have worked on some projects.</h4>

<ul class="listing">
    <li>VR Tower Defense - From scratch for CS579 I built a VR game where the user can place towers to fend off various waves of enemies.</li>
    <li>Genome Stat Sifter - A GUI tool that takes in large sets of genome data and sifts through to find relevant data and display it in well-organized tables.</li>
    <li>Obsidian Collector Tracker - A tool for the obsidian app that runs a javascript to track a set of trading cardsthrough a api</li>
    <p> I do really like developing in obsidian, you can code, take notes, learn markdown,and all sorts of things. to any computer science student out there I would highly recommend checking out <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian md</a>
</ul>
